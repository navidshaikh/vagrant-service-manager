# vagrant-service-manager

This plugin provides setup information, including environment variables and certificates, required to access services provided by an [Atomic Developer Bundle (ADB)](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle).  This plugin makes it easier to use the ADB with host-based tools such as Eclipse and the docker and kubernetes CLI commands.  Details on this usage pattern can be found in the [ADB Documentation](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/blob/master/docs/using.rst).

##Objective

* To provide the user a CLI to configure the
[ADB](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle)
for different use cases and to provide glue between ADB and the user's
development environment.

*  Provide users a tool to control and configure the ADB from the
developer's workstation without having to `ssh` into it.

The [Atomic Developer
Bundle](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle)
is  Vagrant box that provides a ready-to-use development environment
for container applications. With ADB, developers can dive right into
producing complex, multi-container applications.

## Quick Start

1. Install `vagrant-service-manager` plugin:

        vagrant plugin install vagrant-service-manager

2. Get a Vagrantfile for your box. Users of the
[Atomic Developer Bundle (ADB)](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle) should download a [Vagrantfile from the repository](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/tree/master/components).

3. Enable the plugin as:

        config.vm.provision = 'servicemanager'

4. Enable any specific options for the services you have selected:

    * OpenShift

        Specific versions can be specified using the following variables:

        `config.servicemanager.openshift.docker_registry = "docker.io"` - What registry should be pulled from
        `config.servicemanager.openshift.image_name = "openshift/origin"` - What image should be used
        `config.servicemanager.openshift.image_tag = "v1.1.1"` - What image version should be used


5. Start the ADB using `vagrant up`. Users of the ADB may wish to consult the
[Installation Documentation](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/blob/master/docs/installing.rst).

6. Run the plugin to get environment variables and certificates:

        $ vagrant service-manager env docker

        # Copying TLS certificates to /home/nshaikh/vagrant/adb1.7/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/docker
        # Set the following environment variables to enable access to the
        # docker daemon running inside of the vagrant virtual machine:
        export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.28.128.4:2376
        export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/home/nshaikh/vagrant/adb1.7/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/docker
        export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
        export DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME=868622f
        # run following command to configure your shell:
        # eval "$(vagrant service-manager env docker)"

7. Begin using your host-based tools.

## Exit codes

The following table lists the plugin's exit codes and their meaning:

Exit Code Number | Meaning
---------------  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------
0                | No error
1                | Catch all for general errors / Wrong sub-command or option given
3                | Vagrant box is not running and must be before this command can succeed
126              | A service inside the box is not running / Command invoked cannot execute

## How to Develop/Test

1. Install the Atomic Developer Bundle (ADB), as
[documented](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/blob/master/docs/installing.rst)
in the ADB project.  Do not start the box yet.

2. Git clone repo

        git clone https://github.com/projectatomic/vagrant-service-manager

3. `cd vagrant-service-manager`

4. Run `bundle install`

5. Start the box with `bundle exec vagrant up`

6. Review the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

7. Develop the plugin and test by running `bundle exec vagrant service-manager`

8. When you are ready to build the release, get a repo maintainer to:

  1. Put the gemfile in pkg/ with `rake build`

  2. Increment the Version Number

  3. Release the plugin with `rake release`

  4. Tag the release commit with a vX.Y.Z tag

  5. Create a Github release

### How to build the Vagrant plugin using Bundler

You can also use Bundler to build the plugin and install it manually in
your Vagrant environment

Run the commands below inside of the repository:

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake build
````

Install the plugin using:

    vagrant plugin install pkg/<gem name>
